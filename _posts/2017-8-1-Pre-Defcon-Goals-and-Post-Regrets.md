title: Pre Defcon Goals and Post Defcon Regrets 
---

I walked into the week of Hacker Summer Camp with a few goals: 
+ Obtain as many unofficial badges as I could 
+ Attend the talks on my google calendar 
+ Go to things early 
+ Don't get shanked by the Wifi 


One day after the convention, I realized that I did a few things I did wrong:

# I woke up way too early to get on line for registration. 
### I forewent sleep in order to get on line early. My thought process was that if I got in line early, I could get my badge early and go to sleep sooner. After I landed in Vegas at 11pm on Wednesday night, I did not go to sleep until 6:30am on Thursday. The villages and the vendor area do not even officially open until Friday and the vendors don't run out of stuff if they know how to prepare for a 25,000+ convention. 
# I should have stayed through my workshop "Building Application Security Automation with Python" for as long as possible. 
### I stepped out a few times during the workshop to answer a call and go chase one of the unofficial badge makers and every time I came back, I was more lost than before. 
# I spent way too much time walking around and not sitting down somewhere. 
### It felt like I was walking from one end of venue to the other as I was going from talk to talk. Honestly, I should have just picked a track and sat down for a few hours. 
# I should have picked up more hardware related knowledge.
### I came back home with all of this hardware and I knew I should have attended a few of those 101 talks by the Hardware Hacking Village. 
# I Should have interacted with others more. 
### I was set on this goal to get as many stickers and swag items as I could, my brain was on the track of the "Where do I go next?" mentality.
