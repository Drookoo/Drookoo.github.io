title: Defcon 25 Preparations 
---

For the week leading up to Defcon 25 I spent some time learning and polishing up my security knowledge. I got a hold of a few pdfs related to security:

+ Kali Linux Cookbook By: Pritchett and Smet 
+ Basica Secuirty Testing with Kali Linux by Dieterle 
+ Mastering Kali Linux for Advanced Penetration Testing by Beggs 
+ Grey Hat Hacking: The Ethical Hacker's Handbook 3rd Edition By: Harper, Harris, Ness, Eagle, Lenkey and Williams
+ Metasploit: The Penetration Tester's Guide by Kennedy, Gorman, Kearns, and Aharoni 
+ Penetration Testing: A Hands On Introduction to Hacking by Weidman 
+ The Hacker's Manual 2015 
+ Linux Bible by Negus 

I've been practicing using a few resources on the internet like the wargames on OvertheWire.

And of course, on my 1 hour 30 minute commutes to my IT technician job, I lockpick if I have a seat to sit down. 

On the Monday and Tuesday of next week (7/25 - 7/26), I plan to make a trip to the Cybersecurity Lab on the city campus and pick up stuff.
