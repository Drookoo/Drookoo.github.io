### More Information

Andrew spends time outside of the classrooom setting traveling to other schools to compete in hackathons to represent Pace. He mobilizes his peers to accompany him because spending 24 hours to write code, innovate, and network with representatives from tech companies is a blast. On the weekends that he is not attending a hackathon, he goes to the cyber security team meetings to train for competitions throughout the semester. He stays active in the Seidenberg community by attending tech talks, workshops, and the numerous number of competitions that Seidenberg hosts throughout the semester.
